It's a college project which idea is create a portable antivirus. This antivirus is a network scanner which run externally on a computer, without necessity to previous installation of a program. It analyzes URLs and compare with your blacklist and define if  the computer plugged is being targeted by phishing attack. The main objective this project is the creation of a device that can identify phishing attacks in real time carried out through an USB dispositive as pendrive. The analysis will based if the DNS, when compared with a blacklist (meaning the database), will warn the user if the websiteâ€™s domain does not match the accepted public data. The programming language applied was Python. The initial objective was just to analyze the URL where the individual entered, but with a better understanding and development of r0ckPo1nt, observed that it can also be used as a prediction to prevent the user from entering suspicious links. This analysis was verified while testing the software on WhatsApp Web, where one of participants sent a suspicious link as a test that coincided with the data entered in the blacklist and by chance, the software also analyzed the conversations in addition to the URL it was in.

To validate our program, we used zPhisher tool to simulate a phishing attack.
