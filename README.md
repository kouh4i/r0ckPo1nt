It's a college project which idea is create a portable antivirus. This antivirus is a network scanner which run externally on a computer, without necessity to previous installation of a program. It analyzes URLs and compare with your blacklist and define if  the computer plugged is being targeted by phishing attack. The main objective this project is the creation of a device that can identify phishing attacks in real time carried out through an USB dispositive as pendrive. The analysis will based if the DNS, when compared with a blacklist (meaning the database), will warn the user if the websiteâ€™s domain does not match the accepted public data. The programming language applied was Python. The initial objective was just to analyze the URL where the individual entered, but with a better understanding and development of r0ckPo1nt, observed that it can also be used as a prediction to prevent the user from entering suspicious links. This analysis was verified while testing the software on WhatsApp Web, where one of participants sent a suspicious link as a test that coincided with the data entered in the blacklist and by chance, the software also analyzed the conversations in addition to the URL it was in.
